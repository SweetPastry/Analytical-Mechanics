# Visual Studio Code PDF Viewer

PDF Viewer for Visual Studio Code

## Overview

This extension runs the latest `pdf.js` underneath. A demo of their editor (hence ours) can be found [here](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html).

## Why?

Most extensions currently in the marketplace have problems too deep to fix. These problems include memory leaks, outdated dependencies, and several debouncing issues. A priori, this extension does not have these issues and also seeks to provide only viewing capabilities. Nothing more.
