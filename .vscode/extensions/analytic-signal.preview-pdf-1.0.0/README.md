# PDF Preview in VSCode

Simple preview for Portable Document Format files in VSCode. The extension allows you to preview the (`.pdf`) files directly inside VSCode, which means you don't loose focus by leaving the environment to open the document in a browser, and allows you to organise your documents alongside notebooks in the VSCode editor. The main use case for data science is to preview slide presentations and technical documents at the same as working with Python notebooks and statistical graphics.

## Usage

### **Click**
To preview a PDF file:

- Click on a (`.pdf`) file 

A preview of the file contents should now be shown in an editor.

### **Open to the Side** 

To preview a PDF file in a new editor (if other editors are already open):

- Right-click on a file with (`.pdf`) extension and choose *Open to the Side*

A preview of the file contents should now be shown in a new editor. 

## Using an external browser

To open a (`.pdf`) file in an external browser, locate the file of interest in the Explorer, *right-click* and choose *Reveal in Finder* (macOS). From there, double-click to open the file in a browser. However, using the preview extension provides a cleaner user experience.
